### Who receives the money?
Samuel: **OK France** should a priori not take a fee. I asked for confirmation. If no answer within the next 24h, we should consider it agreed. 

**-> Transfer money to OK France, Heidi makes sure the money gets there**


### What tools should we use to track time and progress?
http://www.toggl.com/


### Content planning
- First ideas in GitHub [document](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/material/ideas/course_content.md).
- Data pipeline
- What content around R does exist (we can then sort it along the data pipeline)
- What are the key questions that matter for journalists: it's not just 'how to analyse data with R' but 'when do I use R in my workflow', 'how can I make R work with other tools used by my colleagues' etc. 
- Make sure we ask journalists about their opinions along the way
(Joel will give a talk at French R conference and presents our project there)

**-> Heidi talks to Timo about what we can reuse from RDDJ website**
**-> Camila adds the general learning objectives**
**-> R users add details on how to achieve objectives**



### Write blog post announcing the project
- Include a summary of the results from the previous survey

**-> Camila sets up the blog post**

### Paragraph for R consortium blog
Everyone likes it so far :) Comments still welcome.
Heidi will send it out tomorrow.

### Who receives the money?
OK France would receive it but take management fees (amount unclear).    
**-> Samuel will ask Pierre**

What happens with cofounding of School of Data    
**-> Samuel will ask Cedric**

### How to move forward? / Next steps? / Responsibilities?
Start with thinking about content now
What R content do we teach in the course?
What are interesting data bases for different countries (538 : https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight & https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)?

Gather somewhere (summer camp?) or work online?
Work at the same time -> 2 days working 
Writing sprint (remote/online): 24.4. -- 28.4.
France, Switzerland - 17 h 00 CET    
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso - 16 h 00 GMT    
San Jose, Costa Rica - 10 h 00 CST    

Until the end of the project: Quick calls at 17 h CET on tuesdays + update each other on slack

### Who gets paid for what?
Everyone writes down the hours of work.
At the end we divide the budget by the number of hours worked in total and distribute accordingly.   
**-> Heidi and Samuel check if there are good tools to take time.**

### Report on TODOs / what has been achieved

- Samuel / Joel: Check out existing material 
   + https://rddj.info
      + Great but it's a catalogue
      + Not everything is open licensed (ex. : R for Excel users book not open)
      + We need to create tracks but which tracks (e.g. https://bento.io/), tracks are contextualised learning. Gives you an angle (for example R in the radio). 
      + Find angles that are relevant to journalists
      + Examples are not specifically for journalists
      + Usable
   + Use other people's stuff, if there is already something
- Camila / David / Joel: What do DDJs need?
   + https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IO3BFrZFb8C1QcaaKvCbo902D-9J2xHbmmCqf_ceIoQ/prefill
   + Send out this week
   + Summarize until friday February 3
- Heidi: Costs, what do we need money for?
   + https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I_EgWyiLUpF9-RpF5hlJUFiXgy1Wsunj5KWFpu2qhtk/edit?usp=sharing
   + Test workshop at Open Knowledge festival?
- David: Timeline for material creation
   + Info about material needed
- Joel : check out possible forms of the material: 
   + RStudio instance (cost) / datacamp light; 
   + consider limited internet access in some countries (avoid heavy files and need of staying connected for developing countries)?
- Cedric : draft proposal 
   + https://schoolofdata.slack.com/archives/r-projects/p1483521500000030


### Next steps

Send survey
Summarize survey
Update timeline -> update costs
Check if wishes of journalists can be adhered already with existing material
Which tracks are needed?
Write the outline of the proposal (pinned stuff from Cedric)


Deadline : end of February

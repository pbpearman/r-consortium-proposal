Hello!

I am data journalist working for Swiss Radio and Television ([SRF Data](https://srf.ch/data)) and I have been using R for almost three years – as a means for researching and publishing countless investigative and explanatory pieces. 
In addition to the reporting, we have set new standards in (European) data journalism by publishing most of our [data and code on GitHub pages](https://srfdata.github.io), which got us a nomination for the ["data journalism website of the year"](https://www.datajournalismawards.org/shortlist/) and has inspired other outlets [in doing the same](https://br-data.github.io/diskriminierung-mietmarkt-analyse/analyse.nb.html). R and RMarkdown enabled and empowered us to do this.
Besides that, R has many other advantages for journalistic work, among which are:
1. **R is good at almost everything**: Getting data from a website, transposing a spreadsheet, combining multiple tables, converting JSON to CSV and vice versa, filtering and sorting data, drawing some exploratory plots, preparing data for further use in an interactive data visualization, creating GIFs, you name it. Of course, there are good tools out there that can do all of thath – but with R you can combine everything in one script, which gives you a true efficiency boost.
2. **R is a language, not a tool**: When talking to colleagues in journalism, this is the most often heard argument against using R. In fact, it’s R’s biggest asset, especially in an environment where methods, and not just results, matter. Which leads to the next point.
3. **R supports a transparent and reproducible workflow.**: With R, lying is difficult. Once you’re ready to publish your script, and not just your results, everyone will know what you did – and people will point out your methodological flaws or even errors. But data journalism [needs to be open](http://www.brianckeegan.com/2014/04/the-need-for-openness-in-data-journalism/). And this is hard or even impossible without using a scripting language.
4. **R is easy to learn and let’s you get started in 5 minutes.**: While not all will agree with me on this and while it depends on the definition of "learn", getting started in R is pretty straightforward. Nowadays there are some many [good tutorials](https://rddj.info) and with the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) becoming more popular, R is getting more and more accessible for people without prior programming experience.
5. **R is free and open source.**


Now, enjoy your journey into R – trust me, it's worth it.
